# Emily's Twitter Projects

This repo represents my efforts to develop my skills with JSON, social media data, and NLP. To do this, I have obtained parts of the downloaded archive of the twitter account of someone I know, who has agreed to let me use it for practice.  They have not agreed to having the archive made accessible to the public via GitHub.  This dataset was acquired through Twitter's "download your archive" feature, but in future endeavors, I hope to try my hand at scraping the site.  (See my [scientific communication project](https://github.com/emilyksanders/sci_comm_classification) for my work scraping Reddit.)

### The current project

For my first venture into Twitter data, I will attempt to isolate and extract only the tweets related to the hit (HBO)Max comedy, *Our Flag Means Death*.  I'm hoping to get original tweets, retweets, and replies.  

As a stretch goal, I would like to use NLP techniques to separate the tweets into different thematic "buckets," e.g., "analysis of season 1" versus "speculation on season 2."

### A note to recruiters and potential employers

This project is, by definition, just for fun and kind of silly.  I have chosen to make it public though, because I think it speaks to the possibilities I see for the kind of work that I do, because it will hopefully showcase my skillset, and because I think absolutely everyone should know about this gem of a show.
